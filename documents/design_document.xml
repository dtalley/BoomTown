			<background>				
				The year is 2106.  Humankind sent probes into deep, unexplored space, only to find it absent interesting or useful planets, with the exception of <t />, a planet devoid of life, but rich in consumable resources.  <link>kovanite</link>, a mineral not found on Earth, proved to be invaluable in the manufacture of mankind's most advanced technology, and many large companies rushed equipment and manpower to the planet in order to extract it.  The surface deposits ran out, causing companies to establish mining facilities, which naturally became points of conflict.  Almost a century later, three organizations control most of the planet, and wage an all out war against each other to claim the richest mineral deposits, intent on mining valuable <plink>resource</plink> from beneath the planetâ€™s surface and utilizing them for their own ends.<br /><br />
				
				Players take on the role of a military <link>commander</link>, in command of an immense <link>Mobile Command Center</link> and a small army of <plink>soldier</plink> within, tasked by their chosen <link>faction</link> to secure <link>kovanite</link> and transport it back to <link>faction_headquarters</link>, and hinder enemy <plink>faction</plink> from doing so wherever possible.
			</background>
			
			<implementation>
				<t /> is the planet upon which the game takes place.  From the moment players launch the game, even if they aren't logged in, the setting of <t /> should permeate the experience.  They should feel as though they have suddenly become part of this world, as though their presence on <t /> is immediately requested.  An unregistered player should be plasterd with "Visit <t />" propoganda from each <link>faction</link>, enticing them to "join the fight for <link>kovanite</link>."
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				The player will always need a fictional reason, however unlikely or boring, to perform their actions in the game.  Some players need more immersion than others, and since Boomtown is a two-dimensional game with limited graphics power behind it, the story and setting behind the game needs to be relatively substantial.  A well thought out setting will give the player motivation behind their actions within the game, and a reason to continue hoping for their <link>faction</link>'s success.

			<background>
				Due to massive population growth on Earth, many able young men and women venture to <link>setting</link> to fight for one of the controlling <plink>faction</plink> with the promise of money and power.  With the advent of clone <plink>soldier</plink> and remote battlefield control, commanding an army on <link>setting</link> is relatively safe, providing a very effective lure for the organizations needing substantial manpower to secure their place on the planet.

			<implementation>		
				The <t /> is the representation of the player within the game.  The player creates a "<t /> card" when they first sign up, providing a standard, recongizable way to represent their individualism to themselves and other players.  The <t /> card includes a photo provided by the player, as well as a visible rank insignia so other players viewing the <t /> card can instantly tell what rank the <t /> is.  The <t /> controls a single <link>mcc</link> at a time, and a <t /> fights for a single <link>faction</link>.  A commander doesn't have 'levels' like in normal MMOs, but instead attains <plink>rank</plink>.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>		
				All actions the player wants to take will be 'carried out' by their <t />.  This serves to separate the player from their counterpart in the game, just in case future versions include the ability to use more than one <t />.  The <t /> also helps other players identify the player, because each <t /> will be unique in name and appearance (both of which are provided by the player).

				A <link>commander</link>'s <t /> is essentially an identifier letting other players know how long the <link>commander</link> has been playing.  The <t /> should always be visible any time the <link>commander</link>'s information is displayed on screen, and a history of the <p /> and when the <link>commander</link> achieved them should be kept for each <link>commander</link>.<br /><br />
				
				Additionally, many things the player may attempt to do will require a certain <t />.  Certain actions or buttons may be unavailable, grayed out, etc. and should display a "You must achieve <t /> X before you can do this" message to the player.<br /><br />

			<implementation>
				The player should always be able to tell how much <t /> their <link>commander</link> currently has, whether it be a little progress bar incorporated into their <link>commander</link> card, or one of the statistics that shows up on one of the <link>world_map</link> overlay panels.<br /><br />
				
				A player gains <t /> by performing actions.  For example, winning a <link>battle</link> might grant the player a good amount of <t />, and even losing a <link>battle</link> might grant a fraction of that <t />.  Successfully <link>crafting</link> something should yield <t />, and failing a <link>crafting</link> attempt should grant a fraction of that <t />.  Anything that takes effort on the player's part should grant <t />, and in contrast, simple things like equipping <plink>soldier</plink> or <link>mining</link> should not grant any <t />.<br /><br />
				
				One minor exception to the latter rule should be that a player can give <link>kovanite</link> to their <link>faction</link> in exchange for <t />, among other things.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				<t /> serves as the universal progress tracker.  When a player gains <t />, they know they're progressing in the game, and it should motivate them to continue doing whatever it is they were doing to gain <t /> in the first place.

				The three (3) <p /> within the game are:<br /><br />
				
				<strong>The Interplanetary Kova Company</strong> <em>(IKC)</em><br />
				A defense powerhouse, responsible for a substantial part of Earth's arms trade.  War is an eventuality on Earth, and the need for weapons never waivered.  The IKC is fighting to secure a steady supply of <link>kovanite</link> to its factories on Earth to support the armies of the future.  The IKC is responsible for designing most of the <plink>weapon</plink> used by <plink>commander</plink> of all <plink>faction</plink> on <link>setting</link>.<br /><br />
				
				<strong>Ekova, Inc.</strong> <em>(EKV)</em><br />
				A family-owned industrialist corporation responsible for many of Earth's environmentally friendly advances.  Ekova handles many of Earth's major metropolitan infrastructure contracts, building roads, apartments, parks, and many other civil installations.  Ekova uses Kovanite in many of its projects, and has a vested interest in its continued export from Kova to Earth, preferrably via its own transport ships to internal storage facilities.  Ekova is responsible for designing most of the vehicles used by commanders on Kova, including the standard <plink>mcc</plink>.<br /><br />
				
				<strong>Kovanant</strong> <em>(KVN)</em><br />
				A rogue, technology-obsessed umbrella corporation fighting to take absolute control over <link>setting</link> and turn it into a space-faring utopia.  Many of its subsidiaries on Earth are simply buffer companies used to filter money around the planet and especially offworld to support its military engagements on <link>setting</link> itself.  Kovanant is responsible for many of the <plink>device</plink> used by <plink>soldier</plink> on <link>setting</link>.

			<implementation>
				There are three (3) <p /> within the game, and upon signing up the player must choose one to join.  The decision is permanent, so the player cannot switch <p /> later on.  On the <t /> select screen, it should be readily apparent whether or not they have friends playing for a specific <t />, or all 3 if that happens to be the case.  The player should also be able to see specifically which of their friends is on which <t />.<br /><br />
				
				Each <t /> is distinguished by a color, a pattern, and a logo, where each color is easily discernable from the next, more than likely Red, Blue, and Yellow for the most accessibility.  Each logo should also be easily recognizable by its silhouette alone.  When a <t />'s color is painted anywhere, it should be painted in that <t />'s pattern, for example dashed lines, curvy lines, circles, etc.  Each pattern should also be easily distinguishable.<br /><br />
				
				Each player should also have a <link>fnn</link> panel on the screen that pulls in broadcasts from their <t />, giving them small tidbits of story development.

				<p /> provide animosity for players, meaning a player from one <t /> wants to defeat players from other <p />, so it gives all players on one <t /> a unified goal: to promote and progress their <t /> while hindering enemy <p />.  A <t /> should also provide benefits to its players, depending on the throughput of <link>kovaite</link> or other <plural>resources</plural> and <plink>equipment</plink>, meaning if players substantially contribute to their <t />'s success, either by winning <plink>battle</plink> and securing <plink>territory</plink>, or sending sufficient <link>kovanite</link> back to the <t />, the players should receive perks relative to their actions, such as attack bonuses, <link>equipment</link>, or any temporary improvements to any of the actions they may perform in the game.

				The Arpa9 All-Terrain Support Center and Skyvault Self-Levitating Airbase were inventions of the late Terrance Bilsner, former CEO of Ekova, Inc.  The Arpa9, at first, was primarly used for supporting construction crews as they built transcontinental high-speed rail lines across Siberian Russia, but the gigantic machines proved to be incredibly useful in the acquisition of <link>kovanite</link>.  Resourceful <plink>commander</plink> retrofitted the machines with <plink>workshop</plink> and <plink>warehouse</plink> to help in the outfitting and supply of armies on the surface of <link>setting</link>.

			<implementation>
				A <t /> can either be 'Flying' or 'Rolling', which is to say one flies through the air and one rolls over the ground.  The player chooses which <t /> they would like to control when they first sign up.  The <t /> is also what holds all of the player's <plink>soldier</plink>, <plink>equipment</plink>, <plink>vehicle</plink>, and <plink>resource</plink>.  The <t /> is always stationed within a <link>zone</link> inside a <link>territory</link>, and the player's first <t /> starts out in a random <link>zone</link> within their <link>faction_headquarters</link>.<br /><br />
				
				The <t /> is always mobile, meaning the player can move it around the <link>world_map</link>.  Moving is not always instant, however, with Rolling <p />, unless the use of a <link>faction_dropship</link> is employed.  Without a <link>faction_dropship</link>, it could take a few hours for a <t /> to move from one <link>territory</link> to another.  When a <t /> is in motion, it is essentially not stationed anywhere until the move is complete.  A player can only move their <t /> to a <link>zone</link> that is controlled by their <link>faction</link>.  If the target <link>zone</link> is taken over by an enemy <link>faction</link> while the <t /> is in motion, it will instantly return to a random <link>zone</link> within the player's <link>faction_headquarters</link>.  The <t />'s position on the map also determines how long it takes <plink>soldier</plink> to travel to their target <link>battle</link> if <plink>faction_dropship</plink> are not used.<br /><br />
				
				Flying <p /> are a little different than their Rolling counterparts.  Flying <p /> do not need to use <plink>faction_dropship</plink>, as they can instantly move between <plink>territory</plink>.  Flying <p /> have no room for <plink>soldier</plink>, which means <plink>commander</plink> controlling a Flying <t /> will never directly engage in <plink>battle</plink>.  Instead, Flying <p /> provide a support role to their <link>faction</link> and friends.  Flying <p /> get a significant bonus to <link>mining</link>, meaning they can pull up <plink>resource</plink> much faster, which also gives them an advantage in <link>crafting</link>.  Players using a Flying <t /> also have exclusive access to sell items on the <link>marketplace</link>, which players using a Rolling <t /> cannot.<br /><br />
				
				Travel between <plink>zone</plink> in the same <link>territory</link> is instant regardless of what type of <t /> a player is using.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				The <t /> mainly provides a physical manifestation of the player on the <link>world_map</link>.  Wherever the <t /> is stationed is where the player can mine for <plink>resource</plink>, and the location affects travel times for squads of <plink>soldier</plink> to their target <plink>battle</plink>.<br /><br />
				
				Having two different types of <p /> allows for two completely different playstyles.  Players who enjoy direct conflict should employ a Rolling <t />, and players who enjoy <link>crafting</link> or simply supporting their friends would use a Flying <t />.

				The player is provided with a small number of tokens that they can turn over for the use of a <t />.  A <t /> can transport <plink>mcc</plink> and <plink>soldier</plink>.  Travel using a <t /> is instant, where otherwise it may take minutes or hours for a player to move an object across the <link>world_map</link>.  The player should not have to take any special actions to use a <t />.  When the player selects a button or menu item to perform a move or attack action, if the player has <t /> tokens left, a box should pop up asking them if they want a lift from their <link>faction</link>.  If they say yes, the action is performed instantly, otherwise the action takes however long it would normally take.<br /><br />

Without <t /> tokens, they have to wait a while, so they can't instantly reap the benefits being over a good <link>zone</link>.

				A <t /> is an individual region on the <link>world_map</link>.  When the player clicks a <t />, a new window will transition in showing them statistics about that <t /> and a map of the <plink>zone</plink> within it.  The information about a <t /> that is publicly available to a player should be:
				
				<ul>
					<li>Whether or not the <t /> is disputed.  It's disputed if there are currently battles going on within it, so the player should also be able to see which <plink>zone</plink> have battles active within them.</li>
					<li>If the <t /> is controlled by the player's <link>faction</link>, there may be friendly <plink>mcc</plink> stationed within the <t />, so the player should see how many there are and which <plink>zone</plink> they're stationed in.</li>
					<li>In contrast, if the <t /> is controlled by an enemy <link>faction</link>, there may be enemy <plink>mcc</plink> stationed within the <t />, so if the <t /> is currently open to attack from the player, or is currently disputed by the player's <link>faction</link>, they should be able to see how many enemy <plink>mcc</plink> there are, and where they are on the map.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<t /> control works on a timed sequence of events.  If more than one <link>faction</link>'s <p /> are adjacent to one another on the world map, and neither <t /> is currently in a 'locked' state, those <p /> are concidered to be 'open.'  Any player from any of the adjoining <plink>faction</plink> can attack an enemy <link>faction</link>'s open <t /> at will, and once the first <link>battle</link> starts within a <t /> after it has been opened, the <t /> becomes 'disputed.'  Players from any of the <plink>faction</plink> participating in the dispute can attack individual <plink>zone</plink> within the <t />.  After the <t /> becomes disputed, a timer is started and should be visible to players within the <t /> view, showing them how long until the dispute is automatically resolved.  While the timer is running, players attempt to gain control of a majority of the <plink>zone</plink> within the <t />, and once the timer is complete, the <link>faction</link> with the most controlled <plink>zone</plink> is awarded the <t />.  Once a dispute is resolved, the <t /> goes into a 'lock' state, and cannot be attacked for a small period of time.<br /><br />
				
				If the <t /> is currently controlled by the player's <link>faction</link> and they click on a <link>zone</link>, an option should pop up allowing them to station their <link>mcc</link> on that <link>zone</link>.  This action should be <link>rank</link> restricted, meaning if a player is below a certain rank, they may only move their <link>mcc</link> around within their <link>faction_headquarters</link>, and can't move to other <p /> until they achieve the proper <link>rank</link>.<br /><br />
				
				A <t /> also determines the <link>resource</link> distributions in the <plink>zone</plink> it contains.  The farther a <t /> is from all of the <plink>faction_headquarters</plink>, the better the quality of <plink>resource</plink> a player will get from its <plink>zone</plink> while <link>mining</link>.

				Each <link>faction</link> has a <link>territory</link> on the <link>world_map</link> that serves as their <t />.  The <t /> should be clearly defined from the player's perspective on the <link>world_map</link>.  The <t />, in general, works exactly like a normal <link>territory</link> with the exception that enemy <plink>faction</plink> cannot attack it.  All beginning players start out on the <t /> <link>territory</link>, and are not allowed to leave until they reach a specific <link>rank</link>.

				The <t /> also affects the global <link>resource</link> distribution, meaning <plink>zone</plink> within <plink>territory</plink> that are close to a <t /> will have low quality <plink>resource</plink>, especially <plink>zone</plink> within the <t /> itself, and <plink>zone</plink> within <plink>territory</plink> that are far away from all of the <p /> will have better quality <plink>resource</plink>.

This gives new players a sort of training ground to learn the basics of the game without actually venturing out into the world and having to deal with the hardships that more experienced players go through.<br /><br />

				<p /> are the regions within a <link>territory</link>.  When a player clicks on a <t />, one of two things happens.  If the <link>territory</link> that the zone is in is disputed, and the <t /> belongs to an enemy <link>faction</link> or is currently being attacked by an enemy <link>faction</link>, a new screen transitions in with a localized map view of the <t />, and a few <plink>scenario</plink> dotted around it.  The number of <plink>scenario</plink> is randomized and changes every time the containing <link>territory</link> becomes open to attack.  At this point the player can choose a scenario to participate in, or zoom back out.<br /><br />
				
				If the <t /> is controlled by the player's <link>faction</link>, clicking on the <t /> brings up a simple radial menu.  The menu should include a set of options depending on what the player can do, including:
				<ul>
					<li>An option to move the player's <link>mcc</link> to this <t /> if they're of sufficient <link>rank</link></li>
					<li>An option to bring up a panel with this <t />'s <link>resource</link> distribution</li>
				</ul>				
				<p /> have a <link>resource</link> distribution that is determined partly by the containing <link>territory</link>'s distance from each <link>faction_headquarters</link>, and partly by random.  The <t />'s <link>resource</link> distribution should be refreshed every so often.

				<goal>Provide several different <plink>battle</plink> within a <link>zone</link> that players must complete to gain control of that <link>zone</link></goal>
			</goals>
			
			<implementation>
				<plink>zone</plink> are divided up into different <p />.  The number of <p /> within a <link>zone</link> varies, changing each time the parent <link>territory</link> becomes open to attack.  <p /> are only visible when a <link>territory</link> is open to attack.  Some <p /> may be occupied, as only one <link>battle</link> can be going on within a <t /> at a time, and some <p /> may be locked, as once a <t /> has been won by a particular <link>faction</link>, it remains locked until the parent <link>territory</link> dispute is resolved and subsequently opens up to attack again.  By this mechanism, once all <p /> in a <link>zone</link> are locked, the <link>zone</link> itself becomes locked until the next attack cycle.  When a player clicks on an available, unlocked, unoccupied <t /> within a zone owned by an enemy <link>faction</link>, a simple menu pops up asking them if they would like to enter.  If the zone is owned by the player's <link>faction</link>, they may only click on <p /> that have enemy squads already within or en route.  If the player confirms, a spot in that <t /> for them is reserved.  Afterwards, a screen pops up allowing them to select which <plink>soldier</plink> they would like to send to the <t />.  This can be done later if the player wishes to outfit their squad first.  A simple way to return to the <t /> deployment screen should be available from the <link>world_map</link>, should the player not wish to immediately deploy their squad.  If the player chooses to deploy a squad to the <t />, but does not do so within a certain time period, their reserved position in the <t /> will be given up.<br /><br />
				
				After the player selects the squad they would like to send to the <t />, they are either allowed to use a <link>faction_dropship</link> to send their squad in immediately, or manually send the squad in on one of the <link>mcc</link>'s small shuttles, which could take a while depending on how far the player's <link>mcc</link> is stationed from the target <link>territory</link>.  After all players who have reserved a position in the <t /> send their squads in, they must wait for all squads to arrive.  Currently the plan is to only allow a maximum of 2 players in each <t />, which means only two <plink>faction</plink> can fight over a specific <t />.<br /><br />
				
				Once all players' squads have arrived at the target <t />, a new <link>battle</link> begins.  Additionally, should a player who sends their squad in manually choose to not partake in the <link>battle</link>, they may retract their squad, giving up their position in the <t /> in the process.<br /><br />
				
				If all three <plink>faction</plink> have an interest in a <link>territory</link>, meaning two <plink>faction</plink> own a <link>territory</link> that's next to a third <link>faction</link>'s open territory, it's possible that all 3 <plink>faction</plink> could be fighting within the same <link>territory</link>.  In this case, it's possible that within a single <link>zone</link>, a stalemate could occur if there are 3 <p /> and each <t /> has been locked by a different <link>faction</link>.  If this event happens, all of the <p /> unlock, with the <link>zone</link> still under control of the original owning <link>faction</link>.  If all <p /> within the <link>zone</link> are locked, the <link>zone</link> is awarded to the <link>faction</link> with the most locked <p /><br /><br />
				
				If a player sends a squad to a <t /> within an enemy owned <link>zone</link>, a timer begins once the squad arrives.  If no <link>battle</link> begins over the <t /> before the timer ends, the <t /> locks, with the player who sent the squad essentially 'winning' the <t />.  Once a <link>battle</link> begins, however, that timer is rendered null, and a player must win the battle for the <t /> to lock.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				<p /> give a lot of versatility to the way <plink>territory</plink> change hands within the game.  If each <t /> is slightly different, either in play style or terrain type or map, or anything really, it makes it so taking over each <link>zone</link> is a different experience for players.  Taking over one <link>zone</link> might only require completing 2 <p />, whereas another <link>zone</link> may require completing 5 or 6 <p />.  If each <t /> represents a different game type within the <link>battle</link>, it could also allow players who enjoy one type of strategy game but not another to pick and choose their <plink>battle</plink> and only partake in the games that they like, and let other players handle the rest.

				<p /> should show up in their own section on the <link>world_map</link>, clearly visible, and depending on the importance of the <t />, blinking, or doing something that will surely grab the player's attention.  <p /> will essentially be a history of events that affect the player but that the player did not initiate.  Some examples of notifications could be:
				<ul>
					<li>An enemy player has made a move in a <link>battle</link> that the player is participating in</li>
					<li>An enemy <link>faction</link> has taken over a zone that the player's <link>mcc</link> is stationed in</li>
					<li>A friend of the player has just entered into a <link>battle</link></li>
				</ul>
				<p /> should have differentiating characteristics, or classes, so the player can clearly pick out the most vital <p /> over minor ones that don't require action.  The different classes could be:
				<ul>
					<li><link>battle</link>: a <t /> having to do with a battle that the player is currently participating in</li>
					<li><link>marketplace</link>: a <t /> having to do with an item on the marketplace, maybe the player won it in an auction or successfully sold it</li>
					<li><link>soldier</link>: a <t /> having to do with one of the player's <plink>soldier</plink>, maybe they have fully regenerated or all of their <plink>training_point</plink> have run out</li>
					<li><link>territory</link>: a <t /> having to do with the current <link>zone</link> the player is on, maybe the <link>resource</link> distribution changed in the player's current <link>zone</link>, or the <link>zone</link> or <link>territory</link> is disputed or is no longer controlled by the player's <link>faction</link></li>
					<li><link>equipment</link>: a <t /> having to do with <link>equipment</link> the player owns, perhaps a <link>crafing</link> operation finished, or maybe an item's durability degraded and the item was destroyed, or maybe a <link>faction</link>'s <link>kovanite</link> meter filled up and the player is awarded an item</li>
				</ul>
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				Since Boomtown is a slow, turn-based game, things may happen to the player's <link>commander</link> while the player is not logged in or actively playing, so there needs to be a way to clearly notify the player of all important, relevant events that happened in the world since they last logged in.

				<goal>Provide support players a way to gain money and experience and make a name for themselves via <link>crafting</link> exceptional equipment and selling it</goal>
			</goals>
			
			<implementation>
				The <t /> is accessed via the <link>world_map</link>, and consists of a main screen with either one tab (in which case it's just one screen), or two tabs if a player is controlling a Flying <link>mcc</link>.  The first tab is the 'Buy' tab, which lists pieces of <link>equipment</link> available to buy that other players have listed.  It should be catagorized by <link>equipment</link> type, and probably searchable.  When a player clicks on an available piece, its <link>equipment</link> card should pop up showing the player its statistics.  Additionally there should be a 'Buy' button on the listing, and if the player clicks it a confirmation pops up asking them if they're sure they would like to buy it.  If they click yes, the piece is transferred to their <link>mcc</link>'s <link>warehouse</link> and is immediately available to them.  Each piece of <link>equipment</link> has a <link>credit</link> value associated with it that will be taken out of the player's bank if they decide to buy that piece.<br /><br />
				
				Additionally, support players controlling a Flying <link>mcc</link> are given access to the 'Sell' tab.  The screen should list the player's current inventory of <link>equipment</link>, categorized by type, and when the player clicks on a piece of <link>equipment</link> a screen pops up allowing them to set a price for it and add it to the <t />.  When the player adds a piece to the <t />, it is removed from the player's inventory until it either sells, or the player removes it from the <t />.<br /><br />
				
				Sellers should have access to sale metrics of whatever piece of <link>equipment</link> they're trying to sell, meaning a chart or list or something of the prices the specific piece sold for within some time period.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				The <t /> will be the center of the game's economy.  Players will always have old <link>equipment</link> that they can't use, so it would be beneficial to them to place it on the <t /> and sell it for a few credits to a beginning player who needs some extra <link>equipment</link>.  The <t /> also gives support players a place to make a lot of money to either advance their <link>crafting</link> or support their friends.

				<t /> is a really just a <link>natural_resource</link>, with one minor difference.  Players can donate <t /> to their <link>faction</link> in exchange for <link>experience</link> and <plink>credit</plink>.  Each <link>faction</link> will have its own <t /> meter that fills up as more and more players donate <t />, and once it is full, every player on that <link>faction</link> would receive some sort of bonus or reward for contributing.  This would be made more difficult by the fact that <t /> is used by most <link>crafting</link> processes, so players will need to manage their <t /> and decide how much and what quality they would like to use for <link>crafting</link>, and which they would like to donate.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				<t /> serves as the major purpose of the game.  All of the <plink>faction</plink> are fighting over <t />, essentially, so one of the main goals of players will be to mine <t /> and give it to their <link>faction</link>.
