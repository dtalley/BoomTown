			<background>				
				The year is 2106.  Humankind sent probes into deep, unexplored space, only to find it absent interesting or useful planets, with the exception of <t />, a planet devoid of life, but rich in consumable resources.  <link>kovanite</link>, a mineral not found on Earth, proved to be invaluable in the manufacture of mankind's most advanced technology, and many large companies rushed equipment and manpower to the planet in order to extract it.  The surface deposits ran out, causing companies to establish mining facilities, which naturally became points of conflict.  Almost a century later, three organizations control most of the planet, and wage an all out war against each other to claim the richest mineral deposits, intent on mining valuable <plink>resource</plink> from beneath the planetâ€™s surface and utilizing them for their own ends.<br /><br />
				
				Players take on the role of a military <link>commander</link>, in command of an immense <link>Mobile Command Center</link> and a small army of <plink>soldier</plink> within, tasked by their chosen <link>faction</link> to secure <link>kovanite</link> and transport it back to <link>faction_headquarters</link>, and hinder enemy <plink>faction</plink> from doing so wherever possible.
			</background>
			
			<implementation>
				<t /> is the planet upon which the game takes place.  From the moment players launch the game, even if they aren't logged in, the setting of <t /> should permeate the experience.  They should feel as though they have suddenly become part of this world, as though their presence on <t /> is immediately requested.  An unregistered player should be plasterd with "Visit <t />" propoganda from each <link>faction</link>, enticing them to "join the fight for <link>kovanite</link>."
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				The player will always need a fictional reason, however unlikely or boring, to perform their actions in the game.  Some players need more immersion than others, and since Boomtown is a two-dimensional game with limited graphics power behind it, the story and setting behind the game needs to be relatively substantial.  A well thought out setting will give the player motivation behind their actions within the game, and a reason to continue hoping for their <link>faction</link>'s success.

				Due to massive population growth on Earth, many able young men and women venture to <link>setting</link> to fight for one of the controlling <plink>faction</plink> with the promise of money and power.  With the advent of clone <plink>soldier</plink> and remote battlefield control, commanding an army on <link>setting</link> is relatively safe, providing a very effective lure for the organizations needing substantial manpower to secure their place on the planet.

			<implementation>		
				The <t /> is the representation of the player within the game.  The player creates a "<t /> card" when they first sign up, providing a standard, recongizable way to represent their individualism to themselves and other players.  The <t /> card includes a photo provided by the player, as well as a visible rank insignia so other players viewing the <t /> card can instantly tell what rank the <t /> is.  The <t /> controls a single <link>mobile_command_center</link> at a time, and a <t /> fights for a single <link>faction</link>.  A commander doesn't have 'levels' like in normal MMOs, but instead attains <plink>rank</plink>.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>		
				All actions the player wants to take will be 'carried out' by their <t />.  This serves to separate the player from their counterpart in the game, just in case future versions include the ability to use more than one <t />.  The <t /> also helps other players identify the player, because each <t /> will be unique in name and appearance (both of which are provided by the player).

				The three (3) <p /> within the game are:<br /><br />
				
				<strong>The Interplanetary Kova Company</strong> <em>(IKC)</em><br />
				A defense powerhouse, responsible for a substantial part of Earth's arms trade.  War is an eventuality on Earth, and the need for weapons never waivered.  The IKC is fighting to secure a steady supply of <link>kovanite</link> to its factories on Earth to support the armies of the future.  The IKC is responsible for designing most of the <plink>weapon</plink> used by <plink>commander</plink> of all <plink>faction</plink> on <link>setting</link>.<br /><br />
				
				<strong>Ekova, Inc.</strong> <em>(EKV)</em><br />
				A family-owned industrialist corporation responsible for many of Earth's environmentally friendly advances.  Ekova handles many of Earth's major metropolitan infrastructure contracts, building roads, apartments, parks, and many other civil installations.  Ekova uses Kovanite in many of its projects, and has a vested interest in its continued export from Kova to Earth, preferrably via its own transport ships to internal storage facilities.  Ekova is responsible for designing most of the vehicles used by commanders on Kova, including the standard <plink>mobile_command_center</plink>.<br /><br />
				
				<strong>Kovanant</strong> <em>(KVN)</em><br />
				A rogue, technology-obsessed umbrella corporation fighting to take absolute control over <link>setting</link> and turn it into a space-faring utopia.  Many of its subsidiaries on Earth are simply buffer companies used to filter money around the planet and especially offworld to support its military engagements on <link>setting</link> itself.  Kovanant is responsible for many of the <plink>device</plink> used by <plink>soldier</plink> on <link>setting</link>.
			</background>
			
			<implementation>
				There are three (3) <p /> within the game, and upon signing up the player must choose one to join.  The decision is permanent, so the player cannot switch <p /> later on.  On the <t /> select screen, it should be readily apparent whether or not they have friends playing for a specific <t />, or all 3 if that happens to be the case.  The player should also be able to see specifically which of their friends is on which <t />.<br /><br />
				
				Each <t /> is distinguished by a color, a pattern, and a logo, where each color is easily discernable from the next, more than likely Red, Blue, and Yellow for the most accessibility.  Each logo should also be easily recognizable by its silhouette alone.  When a <t />'s color is painted anywhere, it should be painted in that <t />'s pattern, for example dashed lines, curvy lines, circles, etc.  Each pattern should also be easily distinguishable.<br /><br />
				
				Within the game, the player should also be able to donate <link>kovanite</link> to their <t />.  There could be a meter that gradually fills up as the many players fighting for the <t /> donate to it, and once it is full, all players of that <t /> receive something.<br /><br />
				
				Each player should also have a news feed on their world map that pulls in broadcasts from their <t />, giving them small tidbits of story development about their <t />.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				<p /> provide animosity for players, meaning a player from one <t /> wants to defeat players from other <p />, so it gives all players on one <t /> a unified goal: to promote and progress their <t /> while hindering enemy <p />.  A <t /> should also provide benefits to its players, depending on the throughput of <link>kovaite</link> or other <plural>resources</plural> and <plink>equipment</plink>, meaning if players substantially contribute to their <t />'s success, either by winning <plink>battle</plink> and securing <plink>territory</plink>, or sending sufficient <link>kovanite</link> back to the <t />, the players should receive perks relative to their actions, such as attack bonuses, <link>equipment</link>, or any temporary improvements to any of the actions they may perform in the game.

				The Arpa9 All-Terrain Support Center and Fenix Self-Levitating Airbase were inventions of the late Terrance Bilsner, CEO of Ekova, Inc.  The Arpa9, at first, was primarly used for supporting construction crews as they built transcontinental high-speed rail lines across Siberian Russia, but the gigantic machines proved to be incredibly useful in the acquisition of <link>kovanite</link>.  Resourceful <plink>commander</plink> retrofitted the machines with <plink>workshop</plink> and <plink>warehouse</plink> to help in the outfitting and supply of armies on the surface of <link>setting</link>.

				A <t /> can either be 'Flying' or 'Rolling', which is to say one flies through the air and one rolls over the ground.  The player chooses which <t /> they would like to control when they first sign up.  The <t /> is also what holds all of the player's <plink>soldier</plink>, <plink>equipment</plink>, <plink>vehicle</plink>, and <plink>resource</plink>.  The <t /> is always stationed within a <link>zone</link> inside a <link>territory</link>, and the player's first <t /> starts out in a random <link>zone</link> within their <link>faction_headquarters</link>.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				The <t /> mainly provides a physical manifestation of the player on the <link>world_map</link>.  Wherever the <t /> is stationed is where the player can mine for <plink>resource</plink>, and the location on the world map affects travel times for squads of <plink>soldier</plink>.

				The <t /> is where the player manages the locations of all of their actions.  They can see a full view off all of the <plink>territory</plink> in the game, which ones are disputed, which ones their <link>faction</link> is defending, and which ones their <link>faction</link> is attacking.  Each of the <plink>territory</plink> is color coded, depending on which <link>faction</link> currently holds the <link>territory</link>.

When the player clicks on one, a radial menu pops up with the following potential options (not all will show up, depending on the status and owner):
				<ul>
					<li>An icon allowing them to zoom into the <link>territory</link> to view its zones</li>
