		<goals>
			<goal>
				<description>Provide a 'side' for the Player to fight for.</description>
			</goal>
			<goal>
				<description>Allow friends to join the same team and play towards the same goals.</description>
			</goal>
			<goal>
				<description>Allow anyone to distinguish easily between the different sides based on color, pattern, logo silhouette, or any combination.</description>
			</goal>
		</goals>
		<!-- END GOALS -->

		<!-- BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION 	*** How should this feature work from the player's perspective? *** -->
		<implementation>
			There are three (3) Factions within the game, and upon signing up the Player must choose one to join.  The decision is permanent, so the Player cannot switch Factions later on.  Each Faction is distinguished by a color, a pattern, and a logo, where each color is easily discernable from the next, more than likely Red, Blue, and Yellow for the most accessibility.  Each logo should also be easily recognizable by its silhouette alone.  When a Faction's color is painted anywhere, it should be painted in that Faction's pattern, for example dashed lines, curvy lines, circles, etc.  Each pattern should also be easily distinguishable.<br /><br />
			
			The three (3) Factions are (Placeholder names):<br />
			Norman-McDowell Industries, or the acronym NOMAD, Blue, Diamonds<br />
			The Environmental Liberation Force, or the acronym ELF, Yellow, Circles/Dots<br />
			The Global Defense and Assault Movement, or the acronym GDAM, Red, Irregular Shapes
		</implementation>
		<!-- END IMPLEMENTATION -->
		
		<!-- BEGIN IMPACT			*** What effect will this feature have on the way players will play the game? *** -->
		<impact>
			Factions provide animosity for players, meaning a Player from one Faction wants to defeat Players from other Factions, so it gives all Players on one Faction a unified goal: to promote and progress their Faction while hindering enemy Factions.

		<!-- BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION 	*** How should this feature work from the player's perspective? *** -->
		<implementation>
			A Mobile Command Center (MCC) can either be 'Flying' or 'Rolling', which is to say one flies through the air and one rolls over the ground.  The Player chooses which MCC they would like to control when they first sign up.  The MCC is also what holds all of the Player's Soldiers, Equipment, Vehicles, and Resources.<br /><br />
			
			The MCC has a Bridge, which contains a World Map and doorways to the War Room and the Factory.
		</implementation>
		<!-- END IMPLEMENTATION -->
		
		<!-- BEGIN IMPACT			*** What effect will this feature have on the way players will play the game? *** -->
		<impact>
			The Mobile Command Center (MCC) provides the Player with a base of operations.  It has a bridge where they can access all of the different rooms of the MCC and perform all of the actions available to them.  The MCC also provides a physical manifestation of the player on the World Map.  The MCC serves as the central hub of almost all of the game actions, which means a lot of the Player's time is spent within the MCC managing their assets.
