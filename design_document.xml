			BoomTown is an online, social strategy game where players assume control of a <link>mobile_command_center</link> and a standing army of <plink>soldier</plink> and wage war against other <plink>faction</plink>, mining <plink>resource</plink> and crafting <plink>equipment</plink> to give them an advantage.

			<background>				
				The year is 2106.  Humankind sent probes into deep, unexplored space, only to find it absent interesting or useful planets, with the exception of <t />, a planet devoid of life, but rich in consumable resources.  <link>kovanite</link>, a mineral not found on Earth, proved to be invaluable in the manufacture of mankind's most advanced technology, and many large companies rushed equipment and manpower to the planet in order to extract it.  The surface deposits ran out, causing companies to establish mining facilities, which naturally became points of conflict.  Almost a century later, three organizations control most of the planet, and wage an all out war against each other to claim the richest mineral deposits, intent on mining valuable <plink>resource</plink> from beneath the planetâ€™s surface and utilizing them for their own ends.<br /><br />
				
				Players take on the role of a military <link>commander</link>, in command of an immense <link>Mobile Command Center</link> and a small army of <plink>soldier</plink> within, tasked by their chosen <link>faction</link> to secure <link>kovanite</link> and transport it back to <link>faction_headquarters</link>, and hinder enemy <plink>faction</plink> from doing so wherever possible.
			</background>
			
			<implementation>
				<t /> is the planet upon which the game takes place.  From the moment players launch the game, even if they aren't logged in, the setting of <t /> should permeate the experience.  They should feel as though they have suddenly become part of this world, as though their presence on <t /> is immediately requested.  An unregistered player should be plasterd with "Visit <t />" propoganda from each <link>faction</link>, enticing them to "join the fight for <link>kovanite</link>."
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				The player will always need a fictional reason, however unlikely or boring, to perform their actions in the game.  Some players need more immersion than others, and since Boomtown is a two-dimensional game with limited graphics power behind it, the story and setting behind the game needs to be relatively substantial.  A well thought out setting will give the player motivation behind their actions within the game, and a reason to continue hoping for their <link>faction</link>'s success.

				Due to massive population growth on Earth, many able young men and women venture to <link>setting</link> to fight for one of the controlling <plink>faction</plink> with the promise of money and power.  With the advent of clone <plink>soldier</plink> and remote battlefield control, commanding an army on <link>setting</link> is relatively safe, providing a very effective lure for the organizations needing substantial manpower to secure their place on the planet.

			<implementation>		
				The <t /> is the representation of the player within the game.  The player creates a "<t /> card" when they first sign up, providing a standard, recongizable way to represent their individualism to themselves and other players.  The <t /> card includes a photo provided by the player, as well as a visible rank insignia so other players viewing the <t /> card can instantly tell what rank the <t /> is.  The <t /> controls a single <link>mobile_command_center</link> at a time, and a <t /> fights for a single <link>faction</link>.  A commander doesn't have 'levels' like in normal MMOs, but instead attains <plink>rank</plink>.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>		
				All actions the player wants to take will be 'carried out' by their <t />.  This serves to separate the player from their counterpart in the game, just in case future versions include the ability to use more than one <t />.  The <t /> also helps other players identify the player, because each <t /> will be unique in name and appearance (both of which are provided by the player).

				A <link>commander</link>'s <t /> is essentially an identifier letting other players know how long the <link>commander</link> has been playing.  The <t /> should always be visible any time the <link>commander</link>'s information is displayed on screen, and a history of the <p /> and when the <link>commander</link> achieved them should be kept for each <link>commander</link>.<br /><br />
				
				Additionally, many things the player may attempt to do will require a certain <t />.  Certain actions or buttons may be unavailable, grayed out, etc. and should display a "You must achieve <t /> X before you can do this" message to the player.<br /><br />

			</goals>
			
			<implementation>
				The player should always be able to tell how much <t /> their <link>commander</link> currently has, whether it be a little progress bar incorporated into their <link>commander</link> card, or one of the statistics that shows up on one of the <link>world_map</link> overlay panels.<br /><br />
				
				A player gains <t /> by performing actions.  For example, winning a <link>battle</link> might grant the player a good amount of <t />, and even losing a <link>battle</link> might grant a fraction of that <t />.  Successfully <link>crafting</link> something should yield <t />, and failing a <link>crafting</link> attempt should grant a fraction of that <t />.  Anything that takes effort on the player's part should grant <t />, and in contrast, simple things like equipping <plink>soldier</plink> or <link>mining</link> should not grant any <t />.<br /><br />
				
				One minor exception to the latter rule should be that a player can give <link>kovanite</link> to their <link>faction</link> in exchange for <t />, among other things.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				<t /> serves as the universal progress tracker.  When a player gains <t />, they know they're progressing in the game, and it should motivate them to continue doing whatever it is they were doing to gain <t /> in the first place.

				The three (3) <p /> within the game are:<br /><br />
				
				<strong>The Interplanetary Kova Company</strong> <em>(IKC)</em><br />
				A defense powerhouse, responsible for a substantial part of Earth's arms trade.  War is an eventuality on Earth, and the need for weapons never waivered.  The IKC is fighting to secure a steady supply of <link>kovanite</link> to its factories on Earth to support the armies of the future.  The IKC is responsible for designing most of the <plink>weapon</plink> used by <plink>commander</plink> of all <plink>faction</plink> on <link>setting</link>.<br /><br />
				
				<strong>Ekova, Inc.</strong> <em>(EKV)</em><br />
				A family-owned industrialist corporation responsible for many of Earth's environmentally friendly advances.  Ekova handles many of Earth's major metropolitan infrastructure contracts, building roads, apartments, parks, and many other civil installations.  Ekova uses Kovanite in many of its projects, and has a vested interest in its continued export from Kova to Earth, preferrably via its own transport ships to internal storage facilities.  Ekova is responsible for designing most of the vehicles used by commanders on Kova, including the standard <plink>mobile_command_center</plink>.<br /><br />
				
				<strong>Kovanant</strong> <em>(KVN)</em><br />
				A rogue, technology-obsessed umbrella corporation fighting to take absolute control over <link>setting</link> and turn it into a space-faring utopia.  Many of its subsidiaries on Earth are simply buffer companies used to filter money around the planet and especially offworld to support its military engagements on <link>setting</link> itself.  Kovanant is responsible for many of the <plink>device</plink> used by <plink>soldier</plink> on <link>setting</link>.
			</background>
			
			<implementation>
				There are three (3) <p /> within the game, and upon signing up the player must choose one to join.  The decision is permanent, so the player cannot switch <p /> later on.  On the <t /> select screen, it should be readily apparent whether or not they have friends playing for a specific <t />, or all 3 if that happens to be the case.  The player should also be able to see specifically which of their friends is on which <t />.<br /><br />
				
				Each <t /> is distinguished by a color, a pattern, and a logo, where each color is easily discernable from the next, more than likely Red, Blue, and Yellow for the most accessibility.  Each logo should also be easily recognizable by its silhouette alone.  When a <t />'s color is painted anywhere, it should be painted in that <t />'s pattern, for example dashed lines, curvy lines, circles, etc.  Each pattern should also be easily distinguishable.<br /><br />
				
				Within the game, the player should also be able to donate <link>kovanite</link> to their <t />.  There could be a meter that gradually fills up as the many players fighting for the <t /> donate to it, and once it is full, all players of that <t /> receive something.<br /><br />
				
				Each player should also have a news feed on their world map that pulls in broadcasts from their <t />, giving them small tidbits of story development about their <t />.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				<p /> provide animosity for players, meaning a player from one <t /> wants to defeat players from other <p />, so it gives all players on one <t /> a unified goal: to promote and progress their <t /> while hindering enemy <p />.  A <t /> should also provide benefits to its players, depending on the throughput of <link>kovaite</link> or other <plural>resources</plural> and <plink>equipment</plink>, meaning if players substantially contribute to their <t />'s success, either by winning <plink>battle</plink> and securing <plink>territory</plink>, or sending sufficient <link>kovanite</link> back to the <t />, the players should receive perks relative to their actions, such as attack bonuses, <link>equipment</link>, or any temporary improvements to any of the actions they may perform in the game.

				The Arpa9 All-Terrain Support Center and Fenix Self-Levitating Airbase were inventions of the late Terrance Bilsner, CEO of Ekova, Inc.  The Arpa9, at first, was primarly used for supporting construction crews as they built transcontinental high-speed rail lines across Siberian Russia, but the gigantic machines proved to be incredibly useful in the acquisition of <link>kovanite</link>.  Resourceful <plink>commander</plink> retrofitted the machines with <plink>workshop</plink> and <plink>warehouse</plink> to help in the outfitting and supply of armies on the surface of <link>setting</link>.

			<implementation>
				A <t /> can either be 'Flying' or 'Rolling', which is to say one flies through the air and one rolls over the ground.  The player chooses which <t /> they would like to control when they first sign up.  The <t /> is also what holds all of the player's <plink>soldier</plink>, <plink>equipment</plink>, <plink>vehicle</plink>, and <plink>resource</plink>.  The <t /> is always stationed within a <link>zone</link> inside a <link>territory</link>, and the player's first <t /> starts out in a random <link>zone</link> within their <link>faction_headquarters</link>.<br /><br />
				
				The <t /> is always mobile, meaning the player can move it around the <link>world_map</link>.  Moving is not always instant, however, with rolling <p />, unless the use of a <link>faction_dropship</link> is employed.  Without a <link>faction_dropship</link>, it could take a few hours for a <t /> to move from one <link>territory</link> to another.  When a <t /> is in motion, it is essentially not stationed anywhere until the move is complete.  A player can only move their <t /> to a <link>zone</link> that is controlled by their <link>faction</link>.  If the target <link>zone</link> is taken over by an enemy <link>faction</link> while the <t /> is in motion, it will instantly return to a random <link>zone</link> within the player's <link>faction_headquarters</link>.  The <t />'s position on the map also determines how long it takes <plink>soldier</plink> to travel to their target <link>battle</link> if <plink>faction_dropship</plink> are not used.<br /><br />
				
				Travel between <plink>zone</plink> in the same <link>territory</link> is instant.

			<impact>
				The <t /> mainly provides a physical manifestation of the player on the <link>world_map</link>.  Wherever the <t /> is stationed is where the player can mine for <plink>resource</plink>, and the location on the world map affects travel times for squads of <plink>soldier</plink> to their target <plink>battle</plink>.

Travel using a <t /> is instant, where otherwise it may take minutes or hours for a player to move an object across the <link>world_map</link>.  The player should not have to take any special actions to use a <t />.  When the player selects a button or menu item to perform a move or attack action, if the player has <t /> tokens left, a box should pop up asking them if they want a lift from their <link>faction</link>.  If they say yes, the action is performed instantly, otherwise the action takes however long it would normally take.<br /><br />

Without <t /> tokens, they have to wait a while, so they can't instantly reap the benefits being over a good <link>zone</link>.

They can see a full view off all of the <plink>territory</plink> in the game, which ones are disputed, which ones their <link>faction</link> is defending, and which ones their <link>faction</link> is attacking.  Each of the <plink>territory</plink> is color coded, depending on which <link>faction</link> currently holds the <link>territory</link>.

When the player clicks on one, a radial menu pops up with the following potential options (not all will show up, depending on the status and owner):

				A <t /> is an individual region on the <link>world_map</link>.  When the player clicks a <t />, a new window will transition in showing them statistics about that <t /> and a map of the <plink>zone</plink> within it.  The information about a <t /> that is publicly available to a player should be:
				
				<ul>
					<li>Whether or not the <t /> is disputed.  It's disputed if there are currently battles going on within it, so the player should also be able to see which <plink>zone</plink> have battles active within them.</li>
					<li>If the <t /> is controlled by the player's <link>faction</link>, there may be friendly <plink>mobile_command_center</plink> stationed within the <t />, so the player should see how many there are and which <plink>zone</plink> they're stationed in.</li>
					<li>In contrast, if the <t /> is controlled by an enemy <link>faction</link>, there may be enemy <plink>mobile_command_center</plink> stationed within the <t />, so if the <t /> is currently open to attack from the player, or is currently disputed by the player's <link>faction</link>, they should be able to see how many enemy <plink>mobile_command_center</plink> there are, and where they are on the map.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<t /> control works on a timed sequence of events.  If more than one <link>faction</link>'s <p /> are adjacent to one another on the world map, and neither <t /> is currently in a 'locked' state, those <p /> are concidered to be 'open.'  Any player from any of the adjoining <plink>faction</plink> can attack an enemy <link>faction</link>'s open <t /> at will, and once the first <link>battle</link> starts within a <t /> after it has been opened, the <t /> becomes 'disputed.'  Players from any of the <plink>faction</plink> participating in the dispute can attack individual <plink>zone</plink> within the <t />.  After the <t /> becomes disputed, a timer is started and should be visible to players within the <t /> view, showing them how long until the dispute is automatically resolved.  While the timer is running, players attempt to gain control of a majority of the <plink>zone</plink> within the <t />, and once the timer is complete, the <link>faction</link> with the most controlled <plink>zone</plink> is awarded the <t />.  Once a dispute is resolved, the <t /> goes into a 'lock' state, and cannot be attacked for a small period of time.<br /><br />
				
				If the <t /> is currently controlled by the player's <link>faction</link> and they click on a <link>zone</link>, an option should pop up allowing them to station their <link>mobile_command_center</link> on that <link>zone</link>.  This action should be <link>rank</link> restricted, meaning if a player is below a certain rank, they may only move their <link>mobile_command_center</link> around within their <link>faction_headquarters</link>, and can't move to other <p /> until they achieve the proper <link>rank</link>.<br /><br />
				
				A <t /> also determines the <link>resource</link> distributions in the <plink>zone</plink> it contains.  The farther a <t /> is from all of the <plink>faction_headquarters</plink>, the better the quality of <plink>resource</plink> a player will get from its <plink>zone</plink> while <link>mining</link>.

				Each <link>faction</link> has a <link>territory</link> on the <link>world_map</link> that serves as their <t />.  The <t /> should be clearly defined from the player's perspective on the <link>world_map</link>.  The <t />, in general, works exactly like a normal <link>territory</link> with the exception that enemy <plink>faction</plink> cannot attack it.  All beginning players start out on the <t /> <link>territory</link>, and are not allowed to leave until they reach a specific <link>rank</link>.  Within the <t /> are the same number of <plink>zone</plink> as in a normal <link>territory</link>.<br /><br />
				
				The <t /> also affects the global <link>resource</link> distribution, meaning <plink>zone</plink> within <plink>territory</plink> that are close to a <t /> will have low quality <plink>resource</plink>, especially <plink>zone</plink> within the <t /> itself, and <plink>zone</plink> within <plink>territory</plink> that are far away from all of the <p /> will have better quality <plink>resource</plink>.

Players are free to move their <plink>mobile_command_center</plink> around within the <t />' borders, and mine the <plink>resource</plink> within.  This gives new players a sort of training ground to learn the basics of the game without actually venturing out into the world and having to deal with the hardships that more experienced players go through.<br /><br />

			<goals>
				<goal>Provide a simple way for <plink>soldier</plink> to improve their combat ability</goal>
				<goal>Simultaneously provide a way for <plink>soldier</plink> to heal after <link>battle</link></goal>
				<goal>Provide downtime between <plink>battle</plink> so a player can't immediately engage their <plink>soldier</plink> in one <link>battle</link> after another</goal>
			</goals>
			
			<implementation>
				<p /> are the 'currency' with which <plink>soldier</plink> heal and train up in <plink>skill</plink>.  At a specific interval, every <link>soldier</link> uses a <t />.  If the <link>soldier</link> is not at maximum health, the <t /> is put toward health, meaning for every <t /> the <link>soldier</link> uses, a specific number of <plink>hp</plink> are regenerated.  If the <link>soldier</link> is at maximum health, the <t /> is put toward <link>skill</link> training, so that specific <t /> will increase whatever <link>skill</link> the <link>soldier</link> is training in by 1 or more points.<br /><br />
				
				Any time a <link>soldier</link> participates in a <link>battle</link>, they earn <p />.  The number of <t /> earned depends on whether or not the player was victorious in battle.  After every <link>battle</link>, each <link>soldier</link> is given enough <p /> to regenerate to full health, and past that they will receive a few extra <p /> depending on whether or not the player won the battle, and how much damage the individual <link>soldier</link> caused to the enemy <plink>soldier</plink>.  If a player lost a battle, and a specific <link>soldier</link> did no or very little damage to the enemy, that <link>soldier</link> might not receive any extra <p />.  If a player won the battle, and a specific <link>soldier</link> did a lot of damage to the enemy, that <link>soldier</link> might receive a significant number of <p />.
			</implementation>
			
			<impact>
				<p /> serve to help players improve their armies, but at the same time slow gameplay and progression down a degree by discouraging players from using injured <plink>soldier</plink> in <link>battle</link> after <link>battle</link>.
