			<goal>
				<description>Provide an overarching role that the player can assume.</description>
			</goal>
			<goal>
				<description>Provide an embodiment for the player within the game.</description>
			</goal>
			<goal>

		<!-- END GOALS -->
		
		<!-- BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION 	*** How should this feature work from the player's perspective? *** -->
		<implementation>
			The Commander is the representation of the Player within the game.  The Player creates a "Commander Card" when they first sign up, providing a standard, recongizable way to represent their individualism to themselves and other players.  The Commander Card includes a photo provided by the Player, as well as a visible rank insignia so other players viewing the commander card can instantly tell what rank the Commander is.  The Commander controls a single Mobile Command Center at a time, and a Commander fights for a single Faction.
		</implementation>
		<!-- END IMPLEMENTATION -->

		<!-- BEGIN IMPACT			*** What effect will this feature have on the way players will play the game? *** -->
		<impact>
			All actions the player wants to take will be carried out by their commander.  This serves to separate the player from their counterpart in the game, just in case future versions include the ability to use more than one commander.  The commander also helps other players identify the player, because each commander will be unique in name and appearance (both of which are provided by the player).

		<goals>
			<goal>
				<description>Provide a 'side' for the Player to fight for.</description>
			</goal>
			<goal>
				<description>Allow friends to join the same team and play towards the same goals.</description>
			</goal>
			<goal>
				<description>Allow anyone to distinguish easily between the different sides based on color, pattern, logo silhouette, or any combination.</description>
			</goal>
		</goals>
		<!-- END GOALS -->

		<!-- BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION 	*** How should this feature work from the player's perspective? *** -->
		<implementation>
			There are three (3) Factions within the game, and upon signing up the Player must choose one to join.  The decision is permanent, so the Player cannot switch Factions later on.  Each Faction is distinguished by a color, a pattern, and a logo, where each color is easily discernable from the next, more than likely Red, Blue, and Yellow for the most accessibility.  Each logo should also be easily recognizable by its silhouette alone.  When a Faction's color is painted anywhere, it should be painted in that Faction's pattern, for example dashed lines, curvy lines, circles, etc.  Each pattern should also be easily distinguishable.<br /><br />
			
			The three (3) Factions are (Placeholder names):<br />
			Norman-McDowell Industries, or the acronym NOMAD, Blue, Diamonds<br />
			The Environmental Liberation Force, or the acronym ELF, Yellow, Circles/Dots<br />
			The Global Defense and Assault Movement, or the acronym GDAM, Red, Irregular Shapes
		</implementation>
		<!-- END IMPLEMENTATION -->
		
		<!-- BEGIN IMPACT			*** What effect will this feature have on the way players will play the game? *** -->
		<impact>
			Factions provide animosity for players, meaning a Player from one Faction wants to defeat Players from other Factions, so it gives all Players on one Faction a unified goal: to promote and progress their Faction while hindering enemy Factions.

		<!-- BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION 	*** How should this feature work from the player's perspective? *** -->
		<implementation>
			A Mobile Command Center (MCC) can either be 'Flying' or 'Rolling', which is to say one flies through the air and one rolls over the ground.  The Player chooses which MCC they would like to control when they first sign up.  The MCC is also what holds all of the Player's Soldiers, Equipment, Vehicles, and Resources.<br /><br />
			
			The MCC has a Bridge, which contains a World Map and doorways to the War Room and the Factory.

		<!-- END IMPLEMENTATION -->
		
		<!-- BEGIN IMPACT			*** What effect will this feature have on the way players will play the game? *** -->
		<impact>
			The Mobile Command Center (MCC) provides the Player with a base of operations.  It has a bridge where they can access all of the different rooms of the MCC and perform all of the actions available to them.  The MCC also provides a physical manifestation of the player on the World Map.  The MCC serves as the central hub of almost all of the game actions, which means a lot of the Player's time is spent within the MCC managing their assets.

			The World Map is where the player manages the locations of all of their actions.  They can see a full view off all of the Territories in the game, which ones are disputed, which ones their Faction is defending, and which ones their Faction is attacking.  Each of the Territories is color coded, depending on which Faction currently holds the Territory.  Some Territories may not be occupied, in which case their color will not reflect any of the Factions.<br /><br />
			
			The player can mouse over each Territory and view a tool tip with relevant information about it, specifically:
			<ul>
				<li>Whether or not it is disputed</li>
				<li>The number of battles occuring within it</li>
				<li>The number of friendly command centers stationed within it</li>
